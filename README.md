# 💡 Even Better (Make It Cross-Platform)

If someone uses Mac/Linux, the command is different.  
So you can write:

```markdown
## Run locally

### Windows (PowerShell)
```powershell
.\venv\Scripts\python.exe -m streamlit run app.py

### Change into apps folder 
``` terminal
.\venv\Scripts\python.exe -m streamlit run .\apps\app.py
